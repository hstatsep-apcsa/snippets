# Assignment 2: Control Tower

In this assignment, you will be simulating an Air Traffic Control tower. This program uses data of the Airplane class type. This is a custom class that you will use for this activity. 

Each Airplane object represents an actual airplane that is detected by the tower at a particular instance in time. The Airplane object has a number of fields: a horizontal distance in miles from the tower (as a positive decimal number), a bearing (compass direction) from the tower (as an integer from 0 to 360), a positive altitude (height) in feet (as a positive integer) and a call-sign which consists of letters, numbers, and symbols.

The Airplane class has the following constructors and methods:

## Constructors
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Airplane()` | Creates an Airplane with call sign “AAA01” located on the landing strip: 1 mile due north (0°) of the tower at an altitude of 0 feet. |
| `Airplane(String cs, double dist, int dir, int alt)` | Creates an Airplane with call-sign cs dist miles from the tower on a bearing of dir degrees, at an altitude of alt feet. **Notes: `alt` and `dist` will always be read as absolute values (non-negative); if `dir` is not between 0 and 360, the bearing will be set to `dir % 360`.** |

 
## Methods
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `move(double dist, int dir)` | Void method. Changes the Airplane position by dist miles on a heading of dir degrees. |
| `gainAlt()` | Void method. Increases the altitude of the Airplane by 1000 feet. |
| `loseAlt()` | Void method. Decreases the altitude of the Airplane by 1000 feet, or to 0 if altitude is less than 1000 feet. |
| `getAlt()` | Returns an int representing the altitude of the Airplane. |
| `toString()` | Returns a String representation of the Airplane including all fields. For example: AAL123 - 110.5 miles away at bearing 059°, altitude 4500 feet |
| `distTo(Airplane other)` | Returns a double representing the distance in miles between this Airplane and the Airplane other |

You will first write code to create a plane, "Airplane 1",  with the default callsign of AAA01, starting in the default position of 1 mile due north (0°) of the tower at an altitude of 0 feet.

Your program will then create a second plane, “Airplane 2”, with the callsign of AAA02, starting at a position of 15.8 miles due north (128°) of the tower at an altitude of 30,000 feet.

Next, your program should ask the user to input the details of a third airplane, "Airplane 3", detected by the tower. This will consist of the call-sign, distance, direction and altitude. Once these inputs have been entered, your program should convert the callsign to use uppercase letters, then create Airplane 3 using these details.

Now, your program should make the following changes to the positions of the airplanes:

* Increase the altitude of Airplane 1 by 3,000 feet.
* Decrease the altitude of Airplane 2 by 2,000 feet.
* Decrease the altitude of Airplane 3 by 4,000 feet.
* Move Airplane 1 a distance that is equal to the initial distance between * Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 on a heading of 65°. In other words, if the distance between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 is 4.6 miles, then we should move Airplane 4.6 miles on a heading of 65°.
* Move Airplane 2 a distance of 8.0 miles on a heading of 135°.
* Move Airplane 3 a distance of 5.0 miles on a heading 55°.

After this, your program should print the details of the planes with their new positions, the new distances between each of the airplanes, and the new differences in height between each of the airplanes.

You should carefully follow the format shown below in the sample runs when you create your program: make sure your program produces the exact same output when you input the sample data into it.
